 * 2026-2027 FIRST® Tech Challenge season BIOBUZZ™, modified to use a mecanum drivetrain
 * for robot mobility, one motor driving an intake roller, two servos which pull elements out of
 * corners, and a high-speed launcher motor.
 *
 * This robot starts up against the playing field wall and launches all four projectiles
 * before driving away from the wall.
 *
 * This program leverages a "state machine" - an Enum which captures the state of the robot
 * at any time. As it moves through the autonomous period and completes different functions,
 * it will move forward in the enum. This allows us to run the autonomous period inside of our
 * main robot "loop," continuously checking for conditions that allow us to move to the next step.
